Even with Xilonen DMG Goblet is still good (¬±2% of HP goblet),"That's pretty much it, not much else to say. Calcs done on a full 4 CA rotation in a Furina Kazuha Xilonen team (KQM standards) so it's not your average CA screenshot damage, this accounts for all sources of damage over time. Prototype Amber gives (offensively) only a lot of HP% so it's normal that a DMG goblet with it is still marginally better (by 1.5% or more), even though HP% is now more competitive ([before it was about 4% worse](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeuvilletteMains_/comments/1d1pl3w/should_i_use_a_hp_goblet_and_widsith_detailed/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)). With Tome, HP% goblet tends to win by up to 2% with full Scroll uptime: for context, that's about as good as a single useful substat so not really a big difference at all.

So yea the TL;DR is [**use a goddamn optimiser**](https://frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer/) and don't gaslight yourself by looking only at the CA damage on full buffs with unreasonably high avg fanfare assumptions, unless you want to maximise screenshot damage of course. To be clear, I assumed about 200 avg fanfare on a T9 Furina for all the 4 CAs and if that sounds too little [I link here my analysis/guide of Neuvillette-Furina teams](https://youtu.be/gy4lPSDtydg?feature=shared) and I remind you that **in Furina-Kazuha-Zhongli the average fanfare for the CAs after the 1st rotation is only 190-195** (value taken from analysing gcsim samples so it's very accurate, [check it yourself](https://gcsim.app/sh/dPQCPRRjCh6w)). Xilonen is a single target healer and the fanfare generated from her healing on Neuvi are counter balanced by the missed fanfare on Neuvi's self healing so fanfare generation can't be much faster, also to be fair these assumptions are already generous because the calcs with full Scroll uptime (which requires Xilonen to go on field twice lengthening the rotation) still have the same Furina buff uptime even though it would expire for most of the last CA.

Furina's constellations and other premium upgrades like Kazuha R1-5 of course will influence the results making DMG more diluted, again refer to an optimiser if you care that much about minmaxing your dragon, but in general don't dismiss DMG goblets please they are very competitive and sometimes better: people and sometimes content creators too greatly exaggerate DMG Bonus inflation with Furina & Co, spreading the ""with Furina HP/ATK goblet is better"" philosophy like a religious mantra.

Prototype Amber gives (offensively) only a lot of HP% so it's normal that a DMG goblet with it is still marginally better (by 1.5% or more), even though HP% is now more competitive ([before it was about 4% worse](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeuvilletteMains_/comments/1d1pl3w/should_i_use_a_hp_goblet_and_widsith_detailed/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)). With Tome, HP% goblet tends to win by up to 2% with full Scroll uptime: for context, that's about as good as a single useful substat so not really a big difference at all.

So yea the TL;DR is [**use a goddamn optimiser**](https://frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer/) and don't gaslight yourself by looking only at the CA damage on full buffs with unreasonably high avg fanfare assumptions, unless you want to maximise screenshot damage of course. To be clear, I assumed about 200 avg fanfare on a T9 Furina for all the 4 CAs and if that sounds too little [I link here my analysis/guide of Neuvillette-Furina teams](https://youtu.be/gy4lPSDtydg?feature=shared) and I remind you that **in Furina-Kazuha-Zhongli the average fanfare for the CAs after the 1st rotation is only 190-195** (value taken from analysing gcsim samples so it's very accurate, [check it yourself](https://gcsim.app/sh/dPQCPRRjCh6w)). Xilonen is a single target healer and the fanfare generated from her healing on Neuvi are counter balanced by the missed fanfare on Neuvi's self healing so fanfare generation can't be much faster, also to be fair these assumptions are already generous because the calcs with full Scroll uptime (which requires Xilonen to go on field twice lengthening the rotation) still have the same Furina buff uptime even though it would expire for most of the last CA.

Furina's constellations and other premium upgrades like Kazuha R1-5 of course will influence the results making DMG more diluted, again refer to an optimiser if you care that much about minmaxing your dragon, but in general don't dismiss DMG goblets please they are very competitive and sometimes better: people and sometimes content creators too greatly exaggerate DMG Bonus inflation with Furina & Co, spreading the ""with Furina HP/ATK goblet is better"" philosophy like a religious mantra.

Does anyone else feel like reading Dramione fics almost ruined the HP books for them?,"I‚Äôve been a huge Harry Potter fan since I was a kid. I remember the first time I read the Sorcerers Stone, and I have loved it ever since. I reread the series every few years, and I watch the movies a little less, but they have always been my comfort movies. A few years ago I bought all the audio books and I would listen on repeat. Literally finish book 7 and start book 1 again minutes later. 

But ever since I started getting into Dramione, a little over a year ago, I haven‚Äôt had any pull to read/listen to HP. I know I still love them, but watching Hermione be with Ron, and seeing Draco as the villain, just makes me sad now. I don‚Äôt want to read unless she ends up with Draco or he has a redemption arc. 

Now I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôve ruined the books that have been with me since childhood. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love Dramione, but I kind of miss HP. I‚Äôm hoping that I can get back into them. Maybe it‚Äôs just because Dramione is new to me‚Ä¶.

"Help me understand Hit Die, HP and HP per level","I am stupid. I just realised that I don't understand this even after hundreds of hours in it. I just take it and leave it to the game to give me whatever HP.

I need help to understand this. In character creation, when you choose a class and show the details, WotR shows the HP per level and HP. Some examples of the classes:

* Alchemist: HP per level (5), HP (8)
* Arcanist: HP per level (4), HP (6)
* Bloodrager: HP per level (6), HP (10)

Where does Hit Die comes in? When I update the wiki, I assume that HP is Hit Die. So alchemist would have d8, arcanist d6 and bloodrage d10.

Let say I start a bloodrager with 16 Constitution, how many HP I would have? I think 13 (10 + 3 CON). And how many HP would I get per level?

Finally purchased new HP 2024 set,"Last Sunday was the day I was looking forward to collect the Harry Potter sets and it felt like Christmas!  I do have the Owlery, boathouse, hagrids hut, potions class & for some reason ended up even buying the advent calendar. I've realised I've missed out on a couple of sets that have come out already like Grimmauld Place. Also, with the different classrooms and common rooms, to the library and many more - hoping they will bring out those to add onto the castle as it's weird having rooms separated especially when they're not in order

What do I get next? There are loads I'd like to get.

Gringotts, Diagon Alley, Hogwarts Express, The Burrows, Ollivanders and Weasley's.

The Diagon Alley set goes with Gringotts and then there's Ollivanders and Weasley's which seem to me they may bring out separate shops to form a new version of DA?

"HP car is ruined, insurance company won't pay, but it's still on finance. What should I do?","My car has been leaking rainwater into the cabin. I‚Äôve taken it to several garages, but no one can find the root cause. It could be a blockage or some seal failure. The insurance won‚Äôt cover it because they say it‚Äôs a mechanical issue, not an accident. The water has damaged the electronics, and now every light on the dashboard is flashing (though it doesn‚Äôt seem to affect the car‚Äôs performance - engine, brakes, steering, and lights all work fine).

I bought the car on HP finance, and I‚Äôve got over a year left to pay. In its current condition, the car is probably worth less than the remaining balance. According to the contract, I‚Äôm allowed to terminate the agreement and return the car to the finance company (in accordance with section 99 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974). This seems like the best option for me, but what can I expect given that the car is basically ruined? I assume I‚Äôll have to pay the difference? If so, can I do this in monthly installments, or will I have to pay it all at once? And can the finance company refuse to take the car back?

HP Drucker aktueller Stand,"Hallo zusammen,

aktuell bin ich auf der Suche nach einem neuen Drucker f√ºr Zuhause. Ich drucke selten und wenig aber wenn dann sollte es schon ein Ger√§t sein mit dem ich auch kopieren kann. Um auf den Punkt zu kommen: HP hat ja eine riesen Auswahl aber wie ist das aktuell mit den Tonern/Patronen, kann man da NoName mittlerweile wieder verwenden oder sind die noch per FW ausgeschlossen? Das w√§re f√ºr mich ein KO Kriterium.

Update HP BIOS (and drivers),"Hi All,

Just testing the water out there... we used to use PSWindowsUpdate tools and scheduled tasks to update our HP estate from the Windows Catalogue.  We used this method as we had struggled with using the HP tools when we first started to purchase HP laptops.

We moved to using the HP Script Library instead, which installs the HPIA tool (installed fresh each time) and then connects to the HP catalogue for updates.

For the BIOS, we use an encrypted file for the BIOS password.  All worked absolutely fine until mid-July, then all our G8's started to request the BIOS password at boot after attempting to apply / pre-staging the BIOS update.

I have a ticket open with HP, but when speaking to one of their support guys he mentioned that another customer that he was helping was removing the BIOS Password, updating and re-applying the password again.

We have also taken a first look at HP Connect (as we are moving to Intune) and one of the team mentioned that the process for BIOS updates under this process also removes and re-adds the BIOS password.

Those of you who manage HP devices  

* Is this different to your experience? 
* How are you updating HP Driver and BIOS?

  
and as a random aside... those of you who manage Probook G8's, do you have recurring issues with sound?

"Help with mini PC for Batocera, HP Elitedesk 800 G3?","Hey guys, 

I am searching for a mini pc to put Batocera on to play my favorite retro games with friends on my home tv. I am not new to the modding, homebrewing and emulation scene but I am to Batocera.

"Input Signal Questions - HP 16"" 98785A Sony Professional Color Video Monitor CRT ","I've seen an offer for this monitor online. I could find very little information for this unit outside the listing. The seller explains this unit can display RGsB at only one specific resolution. Not RGBs. The only way they could get this unit to produce an image was by using an Extron 160xi to convert 1024x768 RGBHV signal to RGsB that the monitor supports. I am planning to use this monitor with a modern PC with an RTX 3060Ti. Would I be able to simply use a display port to VGA adapter, then VGA to RGB into the monitor?

Ocho lineup vs HP,"local liquor store has a deal including the Ocho blanco, repo, a√±ejo, and puntas for a good price. I've only recently gotten into additive free tequila and I'm currently looking to try more HP blancos, so I'm deciding between this deal or more of those. I have Don Fulano HP as the only HP I've tried, which I enjoyed a lot (also love Cimarron, didn't know they were from the same NOM until later). I've had Ocho blanco and reposado before, but I'm curious to try the puntas and the a√±ejo (never had any a√±ejo before). Puntas seems to be expensive everywhere so the deal might be worth it.

For around the same amount of money as the Ocho combo, I could get: Chamucos diablo, Tapatio 110, Cascahuin 48, and G4 HP. Also available is Cazcanes SS (also the No. 9 Rosa), Arette 101, Volans SS, Wild Common SS, and El Tequileno SS.

Person with Disability - Got cheated at the RA Puram HP Fuel Station,"My ordeal isn't directly with the HP pump but with the Puncture Care present at this station. 

Context: Took my bike for rear wheel puncture at the Puncture Care here. Puncture hole was one due to one metal piece. The puncture guy who happens to look like gymbro fixed the puncture, but I happened to notice the air still coming out. He immediately, without my consent, inserted another rubber, quoting two punctures. And charged me for the same, 2 punctures = 200. One hole. Got cheated big time. I was exhausted from work and add to that, I'm a Person with Disability (Deaf). So, you can imagine how hard it is for me to find work and survive. I'm currently only doing an unpaid internship, in my late 20s. Also, my communication skills sucks. Coming back to the story, I didn't want to start an argument and just paid whatever and left. Now, my blood boils thinking why do such people exist. I hope he gets all the bad luck in the world!

Maintenance of HP portable : Battery cand SSD replacement,"So ! My SSD is falling behing in storage, and SD card that came with my PC is dying out (slot for SD is unprotected, I assume that damaged it because it is barely used for storage.

The barrery isn't holding up the 11h it should be (even with low power settings and just 5-6 tabs a single world document, at best 5-6h of continuous use...) and I want to replace it.

I know the processes to replace both. M2 SSD, make sure it is compatible with the MB (storage ""language"" and speed, I believe ?) so probably going to copy that of the current SSD. Copy the disk to the new one (I have a SSD to usb box) and swap them. Any things I forgot/should be wary about ?

For the battery (removable on this PC, 4 M4 srews, easy as pie, already removed it for maintenance of the ventilation and thermal paste change), I just copy the spects on the label of the current one, and order a match. But can I order something better in capacity (mAmp/hour ?) without issues ?

No, I cannot get a new one for the price of both parts (about 150 $ with a on To SSD, which is an overkill I might actually downgrade), nor do I want to.

Haiku runs fine on my HP laptop 100%-A congratulations post,"Just tried Haiku, first in KVM, then on bare metal and I have to say that I am blown away at how smooth everything is on bare metal even compared to running Haiku on KVM. Sound works, Wi-Fi works, Internet is reasonably fast on Falkon (everybody's go to Haiku web browser). The absolute opposite of other niche operating systems like RedoxOS (which doesn't boot at all on my laptop) or ReactOS which even sucks on OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED hardware (mjd). 
Downloading packages is not too slow unlike GhostBSD (Robonuggie's vid). Falkon is a big plus for this OS. CLI package management (pkgman) makes a CLI enjoyer like me feel comfortable in Haiku. And Haiku being a UNIX-like OS while still feeling like something quite unique is refreshing.
My salutes to the devs  for this awesome work. In the future where FOSS packages like Zellij & Tmux, Helix editor, or just Firefox is available, I could see myself  using Haiku alongside Linux probably for browsing and entertainment.

I could even go ahead and say that Haiku is very close to being an OS that can be a viable alternative to Windows, Linux, MacOS, FreeBSD etc. It just need more software availability.

As of right now, I'll just continue to use it in KVM and play around.

Also, since Haiku is only single-user and that the user has admin priviledges, does Haiku have a login manager or in general, how does the Haiku team deal with issues of user security and privacy in user space? I would really like to understand because having some curtains around my systems is a habit that has grown on me.",26,1fzhakv,haikuOS,https://www.reddit.com/r/haikuOS/comments/1fzhakv/haiku_runs_fine_on_my_hp_laptop_100a/,3,2024-10-09 02:28:55,Reddit,"Just tried Haiku, first in KVM, then on bare metal and I have to say that I am blown away at how smooth everything is on bare metal even compared to running Haiku on KVM.

HP/Torque Curves Comparison,"Hi all,

I'm considering a change to an EV for my daily. While researching ICE's, its common to compare dyno curves for an understanding of how an engine will perform. For EVs, I haven't been able to find similar information about power delivery. Misha from Nurburgring fame has a couple videos on this topic for the Model 3 and Polestar 2. I was surprised at how different the resulting power curves are (shown near the end of the videos), and I can definitely feel these differences in power delivery when test driving the cars (torque cliff for PS2 vs tapered drawdown for M3). Does anyone have a link to more information like this for EVs? 

Thanks!

Autopilot Device Question: HP T550 Thin Client,"Has anyone had experience with using autopilot on a HP T550, or other model, thin client? We are in the midst of finishing the implementation of windows autopilot in our environment. Laptops and desktops can go through all profiles successfully. Thin clients, however, do not.

  
We have put a bare bones W11 image on the thin clients, gather hash, turn machine off, upload hash, wait for profile to show assigned and verify it is the correct profile, turn device on... Nothing. It goes through the consumer OOBE.

  
This happens on our corporate network and my home network. 

  
Checking event logs, I see multiple ""Autopilot manager failed to retrieve settings"" HRRESULT = 0x80070005.

I have verified these have TPM 2.0 and attestation is set to True. Everything looks good there.

  
I have spent time on a few articles for troubleshooting, and they talk about manually calling the autopilot profile through a length process in powershell. I have deleted the device and re-uploaded the hash.

  
My concern is if we do need to manually call the profile, via this article [Autopilot Marker | Autopilot Profile Fails to download (call4cloud.nl)](https://call4cloud.nl/2022/11/autopilot-marker/), this would be done on all thin clients.

Lift master professional 1/2 hp green sensor,"Hi everyone! 

Trying to save my grandfather a call out. He's got a Chamberlain LiftMaster Professional 1/2 hp opener. It opens the garage door no problem but we get 10 light flashes when trying to close and it stays open. The door will close when you hold the button down on the wall. Based on the 10 flashes and the inability to go down it is likely the sensors I'm thinking.

It has an amber sensor on the left and a green light sensor on the right. I've cleaned both and confirmed alignment as best I can. The wires also look good. 

Currently I'm getting the following behavior from the sensors. 

Amber is always solid amber no matter if the door is open or closed. 

The green light is solid when door closed. When I put my hand in front of the sensor path anywhere down the line I get the green light off, then back solid when I remove the obstruction. 

When the door is open the green light is out. The light sometimes barely flickers but otherwise is off and unresponsive. 

I've tried cleaning the lenses, checking alignment all the way down the door. And the wiring. I've also turned the power to the garage door opener off and on a couple times and I'm not seeing any changes. 

Any more troubleshooting ideas before the tech comes out? ",2,1fzcojk,GarageDoorService,https://www.reddit.com/r/GarageDoorService/comments/1fzcojk/lift_master_professional_12_hp_green_sensor/,3,2024-10-08 22:37:36,Reddit,"Hi everyone!

Fuck HP,"So, I decided to treat myself and splurged a staggering 30 euros on this gem of a printer‚Äîbecause who doesn‚Äôt love throwing money away on devices that work about as well as a cat in a room full of laser pointers?

Setting this beauty up was a delightful experience, akin to solving a Rubik‚Äôs Cube while blindfolded. Apparently, the genius designers thought it would be hilarious to ensure you can‚Äôt connect your phone and Wi-Fi at the same time. Bravo, tech wizards! The instructions were as clear as mud, so I ended up learning way more from Indian YouTubers than I ever did in school.

After what felt like an eternity of headache-inducing trial and error, I finally managed to print some documents. Oh, joy! But wait, they only provided enough ink for a ‚Äúfull month‚Äù if your idea of ‚Äúfull month‚Äù involves printing a grand total of 15 pages. Talk about generous! I also signed up for their glorious three-month subscription, which came with new cartridges that I can‚Äôt swap out for third-party ones because, surprise, HP has decided to put microchips in their cartridges. Yes, that‚Äôs right‚ÄîHP wants to make sure I don‚Äôt use any cartridges that aren‚Äôt stamped with their seal of approval. Apparently, I need their permission to do anything in my own home!

And then there‚Äôs the delightful little side quest of returning those cartridges to HP for recycling. Sure, they provided a prepaid envelope, but I‚Äôm not giving back anything to a multimillion-dollar corporation that has enough cash to buy a small country. No thank you! Even with that prepaid envelope, I‚Äôd rather start my own collection of used cartridges. Call me a hoarder if you must, but I‚Äôm standing firm on this principle.

After reaching my limit with this piece of junk, I made a bold decision: instead of returning it, I took great pleasure in smashing the printer to bits. You know, just a little DIY fun! I then took the shredded remains and stuffed them into the prepaid envelope because why not send them some ‚Äúdogshit‚Äù back? Oh, and did I mention I blew up the plastic casing on New Year‚Äôs Eve? It was a real party!

Let‚Äôs not forget the ink subscription nightmare. Trying to cancel that was like trying to escape a bad relationship. Their website seemed designed to keep people in a perpetual state of confusion, and the ‚Äúcancel‚Äù button? It was basically a placebo. So, I had to resort to actually contacting customer service, which was a real treat. When I casually mentioned I‚Äôd smashed my printer, they suggested I just buy a new one. Oh, you think? I mean, that‚Äôs the dream, isn‚Äôt it?

Bought my first server today - HP ProLiant DL360e 8th Gen,"Been messing around with RPi5s for a plexbox, a media server, and a kubernetes cluster. 

Been wanting to make the plunge with a homelab. Found a DL360e on Facebook market for $100. Just some minimal ram and no hard drives. Server POSTs OK. 
Looking it up, all variants of this server would come with Xeon E5-24xx series processors - still decently modern for the price. Somewhat power efficient too. Dual power supplies, an open socket for another processor.

Looking forward to building it out! First up are a couple of drives and some ram. Going to max out the cpus and RAM and go from there!

How well would the game function if you had a single HP bar?,"Is it even possible? I mean, I know the game rolls a body part, roll for attack and if it beats the AC, you roll for damage, that's pretty much TTRPG, exactly like Nethack and similars.

Could someone, by some miracle, mash together a bunch of code and do a mod that unifies your limbs into a single HP pool? How possible would it be and if it is, how difficult would it be to implement? Would it suffer with incompatibility with other content or would it be as simple as a mutation that just alters how you take damage?

Could alternatives be made for limb breaking and stuff?

Damage Resistance and Effective HP,"So I'm making a video about damage resist and how effective hp is related and I want to make sure I have this right.

From what I understand, effective hp = hp/(1- damageResist). So here is a scenario:

Person A has: 1000hp. 20% bullet resist, therefore, his EHP = 1250

Person A takes 150 bullet damage.

newBulletDamage = originalBulletDamage \* (1 - damageResist) = 150 \* (.8) = 120.

Reality: 1000hp / 120 damage = 8.33, so after 8 hits they will die.

Theoretical: 1250ehp / 120 damage = 10.42, so after 10 hits they will die

So, EHP is a metric used as a tool to better understand damage over time and make informed decisions, especially if you don't know exactly how much damage you're taking.

What I originally assumed was you just take 50% less damage and didn't give it much thought. Then I found out that games commonly use ehp as a metric. After that, I thought you would calculate ehp and then keep the damage the same. ie. 

EHP = 1250, bulletDamage = 150 and stays 150

My thought was that if you are doing 20% less damage that's kind of like you have 20% more health, so ehp accounts for the resist and bulletDamage stays the same because ehp was already calculated. It turns out that you must calculate the hp AND the damage after mitigation, which kind of confuses me a bit.

  
So I'm just trying to understand this, where I'm making a mistake in my thought process. I can understand that simply adding a percentage makes it look more linear but I don't know if I'm thinking about this correctly. Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance!

HP Elitebook 840 G7 ACPI Error and off colors,"Hi everyone,


recently I got myself a HP Elitebook 840 G7 with i5 10310U and I want to run macOS Sequoia on it. However, my EFI is already failing with macOS Sonoma, which I tried to boot from an external SSD.

Specifically, I get the following error messages:
ACPI Error: Method parse/execution failed for SB.PCI0.LCPB.EC0.BTST and BTST and BAT0._BST

After some time, the laptop boots anyway, but the touchpad does not work and the display shows completely wrong colors (extreme green tint).

The problem seems to be in the ACPI folder, but I only understand the bare minimum of SSDTs and SSDT-Time gives me 20+ with little intuitive description. I had tried various SSDTs / patches from Github (shame on me, I know, I know), but did not find any for the i5 10310U (only those for the 10210U - but that does not explain the battery errors).

Do you want over a million HP and 20k bonus damage? -- How to break the beta,"[I broke the game, and you can too!](https://preview.redd.it/jpyp0elcbntd1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef267a4f227d89fd44782ef38ec72f8e5ca20181)

I did this on the Creature character and that will probably be the easiest to pull this off on, but in theory this can be done on any character. To start it off, you want two cursed Spyglasses. I think cursed items have a range they can roll their bonuses, so this might not be consistent... but currently in the beta, it's possible to roll -51% reroll cost on each Spyglass. That means you can reach -102% reroll cost. If you use Fish Hooks, you can force curse on them when you find them. Maybe a few of you know where this is going...

Once you have the two Spyglasses, your reroll cost will go negative. You *gain* money by rerolling. This has several consequences, one is that you can reroll infinitely to gain money and buy any item you want. Another is that once you have Padding, you can scale your HP as high as you want by rerolling to gain money. Another is that by using Bone Dice, you can also scale your % damage as you reroll -- yes, you will proc the minus HP a lot, but it literally does not matter because you'll get so much HP from Padding.

Now, this does require a lot of clicks because for me, the reroll cost only went up by one each click. Nothing Autohotkey with an autoclicker script can't handle. Go make supper, eat, and come back to absolutely ludicrous HP and damage.

# HP Printers are Garbage / HP Ink Scam

I've had my HP printer for about 4 or 5 years and it‚Äôs worked great with both HP and third-party ink cartridges. But in the last few months, HP pushed out a firmware update that started causing issues. At first, it just blocked the ink levels when I used third-party cartridges, which was annoying but manageable.

But recently, another update came through (thanks to their ""Dynamic Security"") and now my printer is almost completely useless. It won‚Äôt let me print, scan, or copy ‚Äì even though the printer itself is still fine. Now it won‚Äôt work at all with third-party ink, and I‚Äôve basically lost time and money because of it.

My main issues:

* HP has basically bricked a working printer I already paid for by controlling it through these updates.
* They‚Äôre clearly trying to force people into their overpriced ink subscription service by blocking cheaper third-party options.
* It feels anti-competitive since they know they control a huge chunk of the printer market, and this is just squeezing more money from us.

Now I‚Äôm probably going to have to buy a new printer just because I refuse to keep giving HP more money for their overpriced ink. This whole thing seems super shady and unfair.

Writing HP/DIGIMON story-need help w final evos.,"Want to do a HP/Digimon crossover fic and am considering who should get what as a final stage. (That‚Äôs gets seen, not everyone is going to mega because F writing everyone 30 people‚Äôs journey to mega.)

I‚Äôm trying to keep it to Digimon who aren‚Äôt too technologically advanced for characters who aren‚Äôt familiar with the muggle world.

I‚Äôm also aiming to keep more powerful and important characters with more powerful digimon (though nothing ultra/super ultimate E.g Tlalocmon, Shakamon, burst modes etc)

This is my list that I made nearly two years ago, just out of the blue-since that time we‚Äôve had nearly a hundred new Digimon and I didn‚Äôt write my original reasonings down so a lot of this is speculation. 

 Feel free to give me advice and make connections to other Digimon as you see fit.

EDIT: It has just occurred to me that I never used the royal knights, vortex warriors or 90% of the Olympos 12-nearly all of which would have fit here-I think I was saving them for something and forgot what?



Dumbledore-ancientwisemon -old, knowledgeable, virus attribute ‚Äòchanges his environment‚Äô 

McGonagall-Apollomon-Fiery lion. Nuff said.

Flitwick-thunderbirdmon/Eaglemon- Despite being called Ravenclaw, the symbol is an eagle, a Gold Eagle.

Sprout-hydramon-Big wild plant, I doubt she‚Äôd care for cutesy waifu stuff.

Snape-plutomon-Dark but for a good cause.

Aurora-Dianamon-Astronomy.

Madam Pomfrey- cutemon- Healing 

Hagrid-Unimon- Unicorns

Voldemort-Barbamon- Big evil wizard for big evil wizard.

Harry-victoryGreymon-stuck on this one 

Hermione-CresGarurumon-stuck on this one

Ron-blitzgreymon-stuck on this one

Fred-Jokermon- Identical twins identical Digimon.

George-Jokermon-Identical twins, identical Digimon.

Percy-guardromon- obeys rules, kind of clunky.

Bill-mummymon- Not important enough for Pharohmon IMO.

Charlie-Red veedramon-DRAGON. Red Dragon

Molly-Swanmon- Nurturing, hisses when mad.

Arthur-Tinmon- muggle toy.

Nevil-mystimon- Sword of G reference?

Seamus-Bombermon- Explosive.

Luna-piximon- No description needed.

Cho-yagataramon-Ravenclaw reference?

Draco-groundramon- Green Dragon-stuck on this one‚Ä¶

Sirius-Siriusmon- Hehe.

Remus-weregarurumon-aroooo.

Tonks-Betsumon- Both weird and like to play dress up.

Totally unsure:

Padma 

Pavarti

Cedric diggory

Roger Davies

Marcus Flint 

Potential.

Petunia-Rosemon- she might be the one character I give a burst mode to just for the sheer fun of making a ratty muggle lady stronger then everyone else. Also might make her a biomerge/fusion, just to give her a sense of ‚Äòbeing magical‚Äô

Dumbledore-ancientwisemon -old, knowledgeable, virus attribute ‚Äòchanges his environment‚Äô 

McGonagall-Apollomon-Fiery lion. Nuff said.

Flitwick-thunderbirdmon/Eaglemon- Despite being called Ravenclaw, the symbol is an eagle, a Gold Eagle.

Feeling a little squishy in the 400% dungeons? How to be super tanky with only 2 modules,"This post is mostly for benefit of newer (and returning) players, but also for veterans who've trended with *glassy* builds for quite a while simply because much of the content *allows for glassy builds.* The new 400% dungeons can be deceptive because some glassy or semi-glassy builds can do fine in most of the dungeon, but the double-boss rooms can potentially still down you every now and then unless you're tanky enough. And of course, newer players are going to want to run the 400% dungeons because of the ETA-0 shop, but odds are they haven't yet digested the ""meta"" about survivability and EHP yet.

The short story is simple, and it's based on EHP (effective health pool) principles plus *opportunity cost* principles, which means you don't want to ""waste"" your precious 10 mod slots on too many survival-based mods. You want the *lowest-cost* approach to the *most EHP* possible. This can be done with only 2 mod slots.

Here's the TL;DR:

* 2 mod slots: ""Increased HP"" plus either ""HP Amplification"" or ""Stim Accelerant""
* Your components should be HP/HP, HP, HP/DEF, HP (Aux, Sensor, Memory, Processor, in that order). Ideally your memory will be from the Annihilation set (because it's the only memory with 646 HP instead of the usual 484 HP). The rest of your components will be ""vanilla"" (not from any set).
* This will land you at 5-6K DEF and 22-25K HP, leaving you 8 mod slots to focus on your skill damage and utility.
* A very important point is to *avoid all DEF-based* mods. Even if a given meta build uses ""Spear & Shield"", you're using it for the +8% Skill Power, *not for the DEF stat on it*. The diminishing returns point for DEF is 5K, and for elemental resist, the diminishing returns point is 3-4K. You can hit both of these diminishing returns points with your components alone. (And many players choose to skip elemental resist entirely if they are built for optimal EHP with 22-25K HP (or Shield.)
* Shield-based descendants follow a different mod strategy, so discussing those are out of scope of this post and the linked guides below. The TL;DR on them, however, is that Shield = HP. In many cases, you're simply using a combination of mods that convert your HP into Shield instead, plus mechanics that recover your shield instead of recovering your HP. So even for shield-based descendants, ""optimally tanky"" is still in the neighborhood of 5-6K DEF and 25-27K Shield (or more).

Some players will undoubtedly argue that 22-25K HP (or shield) is ""overkill"" and that they run with much less. That's their prerogative, and they're certainly *not* wrong for much of the game's content, even in Hard mode. Remember, this advice revolves around the *hardest* content in the game: intercepts, invasions, and the new 400% dungeons. If you tackle these with anything less than *optimal EHP*, that's on you. Some of you are skilled enough at avoiding damage that you can do all this content just fine with only 15K or 11K or 8K HP. That's great! Just understand that newer players, especially, might not understand fight mechanics well enough -- or have the twitch skills and situational awareness -- to avoid damage as well as you can. For *them*, it can be a huge benefit to themselves (and their team mates) to just run *tanky* with optimal EHP in these more difficult content types. In other words, *you* might need only 1 HP mod, but some players might need 2 HP mods to minimize their own frustration and to be less of a drag on their team.

If you want to dive deeper than the TL;DR and *understand* EHP in this game, and you want to see diminishing returns graphs and stuff like that, then check out these two EHP guides I wrote a couple months ago:

""RACERRRZ"" assumes no responsibility or liability for any damage, injury, or loss that may occur as a result of following the instructions herein. Users should exercise caution and ensure proper understanding of the procedures before attempting any hardware installation.

¬†**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

¬†

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

¬†**Pre-fitment - BIOS Update and System Check:**  
**‚Ä¢ Visit HP‚Äôs website to download the appropriate BIOS for your system. It‚Äôs best to update your system‚Äôs BIOS before you upgrade to avoid CPU detection issues. Using HP‚Äôs installation assistant from within your OS will make this process seamless. There are alternative methods to update the BIOS but that‚Äôs beyond the scope of this CPU fitment guide. Ensure your system has stable power during the update ‚Äì power loss can result in BIOS corruption.**

https://preview.redd.it/oqmse42s6ctd1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=daa1e46052a52e39ab4cc6de01c306b6e1afb58d

**Once complete ‚Äì ensure your system still boots into your OS.**

¬†**1. Prepare Your Work Area:**  
**‚Ä¢ Ensure your workstation is on a flat, static-free surface.**  
**‚Ä¢ Use an ESD wrist strap and mat to prevent static damage to the motherboard and processors.**  
**‚Ä¢ Power down the workstation, unplug all cables, and remove the side panel to access the internal components. Hold the power button for a few seconds to drain capacitors.**

https://preview.redd.it/xht9pjot6ctd1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=a719566bf8ac2dd568c7b88fde486fcc204d6e03

¬†**2. CPU removal (if fitted):**  
**‚Ä¢ Locate the CPU coolers and remove the coolers. Follow the recommended removal steps. An extended T30 torx bit will be required to clear the cooler‚Äôs height. There are four screws that need to be undone ‚Äì follow the guidance printed on your cooler or visit Intel‚Äôs website (LGA 3647 socket) for removal guidance. Take care ‚Äì the CPU is held to the cooler with a plastic carrier. The CPU could remain behind if the carrier was absent or broken ‚Äì so take caution when removing the CPU cooler.** 

**For interest - I checked the torque on my CPU cooler when removing - torque ranged from 4-7 In-LBS across the T30 torx screws - likely due to not being fitted with a torque screwdriver by the previous owner.**

https://preview.redd.it/a5meb4wv6ctd1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=11bd7ab7eedb090c22852ec62136a7bb5aadb94d

**‚Ä¢ If fitting new CPUs, remove the first Xeon processor from its packaging, handling it by the edges to avoid contact with the delicate pins and surface. Inspect the golden contact surface for thermal paste. If present you can use cloth and isopropyl alcohol to clean the contact pad surface, but take care ‚Äì the golden pads can dismount with agitation ‚Äì so be gentle. Also check for thermal paste on the exposed resistors near the center of the CPU. Electrically conductive thermal paste would be detrimental ‚Äì so best to remove paste from this region if present. Again, be gentle.**

https://preview.redd.it/39k8blyy6ctd1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=afcd62c9ee28d38a5d25a0ea9edcfc42789ecbb4

¬†**3. Thermal Paste Application:**  
**‚Ä¢ Thermal paste is best applied to the CPU to ensure full coverage of the IHS surface. Start with a generous volume of thermal paste application - \~0.5ml / a large blob. Ideally this needs to be spread using a plastic credit card or thermal paste spreader. Apply light pressure to the thermal paste when spreading. This process will take some time ‚Äì but it‚Äôs worth the effort to obtain 100% coverage. Then proceed to apply 5 small blobs of thermal paste at equidistant points over the IHS surface. This will help with filling imperfections and should help to avoid air pockets from forming.**

https://preview.redd.it/e5wx92vx6ctd1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a23540015e8458f83e1fb1d64c9d630e4612124

¬†**4. Mate CPU with plastic CPU carrier and then cooler:**  
**‚Ä¢ Align the triangular notches on the CPU with the notches on the CPU carrier. There are two hooks that hold the CPU in place. Take care to not damage these carriers. LGA 3647 carriers are different between the CPU 0 and CPU 1 for the Z8 G4. The carriers have a specific mounting mechanism to clip into the CPU cooler. Ensure all four corners of the carrier clip into the cooler. Visually inspect the cooler, carrier and CPU for flush fitment ‚Äì error here can lead to cracked CPU silicon ‚Äì so take your time to check that it‚Äôs all flush.**

https://preview.redd.it/ws6s57417ctd1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b2c3902dbc2390f15a233420963bd0f81db1be

¬†**5. Mount the CPU Cooler:**  
**‚Ä¢ Remove the protective plastic cover on the socket and refit the CPU cooler and CPU. Check for the triangle to orient the cooler direction correctly. Make sure to obtain good fitment with the socket. Plug in the CPU fan connector while there ‚Äì it‚Äôs more difficult to fit that later ‚Äì but be cautious to not drop or bump the cooler/CPU.**  
**‚Ä¢ Start each T30 torx screw by hand to ensure they grab correctly before starting to use a torque screwdriver. Tighten the CPU using a digital torque screwdriver to Intel‚Äôs recommended specification for the LGA 3647 socket. Recommended torque specifications: 12 in-lb or 1.3558Nm. If accuracy of your torque screwdriver is unknown ‚Äì it‚Äôs better to under-torque than to over-torque.**

¬†**6. Repeat for the Second Xeon CPU:**  
**‚Ä¢ Repeat the process for the second CPU (CPU1).**

¬†**7. Reassemble the Workstation:**  
**‚Ä¢ Once both CPUs and coolers are installed, double-check all fan connections.**  
**‚Ä¢ Reinstall all removed panels and the workstation‚Äôs side panel.**  
**‚Ä¢ Reconnect all external cables and power on the machine.**

https://preview.redd.it/t6v2rolf7ctd1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=17124cec749f9dd036e8fc4669c08c6021743161

¬†**8. Post-fitment - System Check:**  
**‚Ä¢ Power on the workstation and enter the BIOS by pressing the appropriate key (usually F10 for HP).**  
**‚Ä¢ Verify that both processors are recognized by the system.**  
**‚Ä¢ Check CPU temperatures and fan speeds to ensure everything is functioning correctly.**  
**‚Ä¢ Exit the BIOS and boot into your operating system to confirm full functionality.**

¬†

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

¬†**Pre-fitment - BIOS Update and System Check:**  
**‚Ä¢ Visit HP‚Äôs website to download the appropriate BIOS for your system. It‚Äôs best to update your system‚Äôs BIOS before you upgrade to avoid CPU detection issues. Using HP‚Äôs installation assistant from within your OS will make this process seamless. There are alternative methods to update the BIOS but that‚Äôs beyond the scope of this CPU fitment guide. Ensure your system has stable power during the update ‚Äì power loss can result in BIOS corruption.**

https://preview.redd.it/oqmse42s6ctd1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=daa1e46052a52e39ab4cc6de01c306b6e1afb58d

https://preview.redd.it/4uvmembr6ctd1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=c819aa2ae92416e517f2e57036c6d02a7a8eec78

**Once complete ‚Äì ensure your system still boots into your OS.**

¬†**1. Prepare Your Work Area:**  
**‚Ä¢ Ensure your workstation is on a flat, static-free surface.**  
**‚Ä¢ Use an ESD wrist strap and mat to prevent static damage to the motherboard and processors.**  
**‚Ä¢ Power down the workstation, unplug all cables, and remove the side panel to access the internal components. Hold the power button for a few seconds to drain capacitors.**

https://preview.redd.it/xht9pjot6ctd1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=a719566bf8ac2dd568c7b88fde486fcc204d6e03

¬†**2. CPU removal (if fitted):**  
**‚Ä¢ Locate the CPU coolers and remove the coolers. Follow the recommended removal steps. An extended T30 torx bit will be required to clear the cooler‚Äôs height. There are four screws that need to be undone ‚Äì follow the guidance printed on your cooler or visit Intel‚Äôs website (LGA 3647 socket) for removal guidance. Take care ‚Äì the CPU is held to the cooler with a plastic carrier. The CPU could remain behind if the carrier was absent or broken ‚Äì so take caution when removing the CPU cooler.** 

**For interest - I checked the torque on my CPU cooler when removing - torque ranged from 4-7 In-LBS across the T30 torx screws - likely due to not being fitted with a torque screwdriver by the previous owner.**

https://preview.redd.it/a5meb4wv6ctd1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=11bd7ab7eedb090c22852ec62136a7bb5aadb94d

**‚Ä¢ If fitting new CPUs, remove the first Xeon processor from its packaging, handling it by the edges to avoid contact with the delicate pins and surface. Inspect the golden contact surface for thermal paste. If present you can use cloth and isopropyl alcohol to clean the contact pad surface, but take care ‚Äì the golden pads can dismount with agitation ‚Äì so be gentle. Also check for thermal paste on the exposed resistors near the center of the CPU. Electrically conductive thermal paste would be detrimental ‚Äì so best to remove paste from this region if present. Again, be gentle.**

https://preview.redd.it/39k8blyy6ctd1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=afcd62c9ee28d38a5d25a0ea9edcfc42789ecbb4

¬†**3. Thermal Paste Application:**  
**‚Ä¢ Thermal paste is best applied to the CPU to ensure full coverage of the IHS surface. Start with a generous volume of thermal paste application - \~0.5ml / a large blob. Ideally this needs to be spread using a plastic credit card or thermal paste spreader. Apply light pressure to the thermal paste when spreading. This process will take some time ‚Äì but it‚Äôs worth the effort to obtain 100% coverage. Then proceed to apply 5 small blobs of thermal paste at equidistant points over the IHS surface. This will help with filling imperfections and should help to avoid air pockets from forming.**

https://preview.redd.it/e5wx92vx6ctd1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a23540015e8458f83e1fb1d64c9d630e4612124

¬†**4. Mate CPU with plastic CPU carrier and then cooler:**  
**‚Ä¢ Align the triangular notches on the CPU with the notches on the CPU carrier. There are two hooks that hold the CPU in place. Take care to not damage these carriers. LGA 3647 carriers are different between the CPU 0 and CPU 1 for the Z8 G4. The carriers have a specific mounting mechanism to clip into the CPU cooler. Ensure all four corners of the carrier clip into the cooler. Visually inspect the cooler, carrier and CPU for flush fitment ‚Äì error here can lead to cracked CPU silicon ‚Äì so take your time to check that it‚Äôs all flush.**

https://preview.redd.it/ws6s57417ctd1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b2c3902dbc2390f15a233420963bd0f81db1be

¬†**5. Mount the CPU Cooler:**  
**‚Ä¢ Remove the protective plastic cover on the socket and refit the CPU cooler and CPU. Check for the triangle to orient the cooler direction correctly. Make sure to obtain good fitment with the socket. Plug in the CPU fan connector while there ‚Äì it‚Äôs more difficult to fit that later ‚Äì but be cautious to not drop or bump the cooler/CPU.**  
**‚Ä¢ Start each T30 torx screw by hand to ensure they grab correctly before starting to use a torque screwdriver. Tighten the CPU using a digital torque screwdriver to Intel‚Äôs recommended specification for the LGA 3647 socket. Recommended torque specifications: 12 in-lb or 1.3558Nm. If accuracy of your torque screwdriver is unknown ‚Äì it‚Äôs better to under-torque than to over-torque.**

¬†**6. Repeat for the Second Xeon CPU:**  
**‚Ä¢ Repeat the process for the second CPU (CPU1).**

¬†**7. Reassemble the Workstation:**  
**‚Ä¢ Once both CPUs and coolers are installed, double-check all fan connections.**  
**‚Ä¢ Reinstall all removed panels and the workstation‚Äôs side panel.**  
**‚Ä¢ Reconnect all external cables and power on the machine.**

https://preview.redd.it/t6v2rolf7ctd1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=17124cec749f9dd036e8fc4669c08c6021743161

¬†**8. Post-fitment - System Check:**  
**‚Ä¢ Power on the workstation and enter the BIOS by pressing the appropriate key (usually F10 for HP).**  
**‚Ä¢ Verify that both processors are recognized by the system.**  
**‚Ä¢ Check CPU temperatures and fan speeds to ensure everything is functioning correctly.**  
**‚Ä¢ Exit the BIOS and boot into your operating system to confirm full functionality.**

1000 hp out of factory ,,6,1fxnn8s,agent00,https://v.redd.it/e9jdezewl6td1,0,2024-10-06 18:46:03,Reddit,1000 hp out of factory ,1000 hp factory
-1400 hp,"Out of curiosity, if I were to get maton sword(-1000hp) and arachnidemon(-400hp) in one armor would I get 1 hp at low levels. 

Also when I have 1 hp, does that mean that 1% of it is still 1 hp. Hence that means that I can use skills that rely on 1% hp infinitely cause my hp is at 1% all the time right?

For example if I were to use saber aura on 1 hp, will it stack infinitely cause it has no more hp to take or will I just die.

EDIT:
Is 1 as max hp impossible or improbable? Just want to know.",2,1fxcaw8,ToramOnline,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToramOnline/comments/1fxcaw8/1400_hp/,12,2024-10-06 08:58:10,Reddit,"Out of curiosity, if I were to get maton sword(-1000hp) and arachnidemon(-400hp) in one armor would I get 1 hp at low levels.

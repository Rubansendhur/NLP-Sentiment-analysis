Lenovo M715q optimization guide,"The M715q is an interesting mini PC because it is an almost-acceptable gaming machine that you can buy for $75 used. Look for one with the AMD 2400ge or 2200ge CPU. These come with a built-in AMD Vega GPU. This is a weak GPU by modern standards (a little slower than a GeForce 1030) but will run circles around the Intel GPUs found in almost all mini PCs. With the tweaks below you will be able to play some modern 3d games, which is kind of a feat for a $75 mini PC.

This doesn't get you a *good* gaming PC, but it is honestly kind of a great TV-top Steam box (paired with any Bluetooth controller). I use it for casual couch play, and occasionally put it in my backpack for work trips or vacations.


Necessary steps for gaming performance:
1. Ensure that your machine has two sticks of ram. This is a requirement for dual-channel memory access, which is necessary for good GPU performance. It is simple and cheap to add a second stick if necessary.
2. Most machines will come with 2666mhz ram. In my experience it was trivial to overclock it to 3200mhz using https://github.com/DavidS95/Smokeless_UMAF which greatly increases CPU and GPU performance.
3. I have heard elsewhere on Reddit that a 95w power supply will enhance performance significantly over the default 65w power supply. It takes a standard Lenovo ""Slim Tip"" laptop plug. It basically looks like a square yellow USB plug.
4. You can tweak CPU and GPU power limits with https://github.com/JamesCJ60/Universal-x86-Tuning-Utility. So far I have not gotten any great improvements. Perhaps a few % gained from increasing GPU TDC and EDC limits to maximum.
5. Since this is an AMD system you can get significant FPS gains in games using FSR tech (which allows you to play games at low resolution but upscales them to look like full resolution). Some games have official support. For all others, simply install Universal x86 Tuning Utility above, enable ""UXTU Super Resolution"", start your game in low resolution windowed mode, then press Alt-F to upscale it to full screen.
6. If you find that your desktop is stuck at low resolution, check which DisplayPort you are using. There are up to 3 ports. One has a metal rim. AVOID the metal-rimmed port. It is limited to very low bandwidth in my experience.

Lenovo's laptop deals,"Heya

I noticed the Lenovo website has deals on it's laptops... Like 35% off for some of them, but the prices are still high.

I'm just wondering are these ""constant deals""... Whereby it's just how Lenovo markets it's products on it's website and they are available all year round. Or is it a legitimate sale for the month of October?

And is there any way to stack further discounts? I asked a Lenovo rep if I could get a laptop cheaper and they said the laptop was already priced with the best discounts.

An example is the Legion 7i here for $3000 down from $4400 but not sure how legit that original price is as it's crazy high:

Steam deck oled vs Lenovo legion go ,"All advice is welcomed but I'm really interested in seeing what users who used both have to say.
I will use the console to mostly play older ,less demanding games,I have a good PC If I want to play the latest and greatest games.
Battery life is important to me since i will be gaming on the go,but if the legion go is the better console and can last close to 2.5 ,3 hours while playing a game like Dark Souls 1 for example I would be content.
From reading/watching various reviews I learned that the steam deck oled has the best battery life besides the rog ally x (which I've excluded from my list due to having a smaller screen than both,I've played a little with the og rog ally in a electronics store and the small screen turned me off).
That being said ,I've heard that it takes a few hours to fully charge the steam deck since it doesn't have fast charge while the legion go can be fully charged in like an hour.
Then there is the user experience, reviewers were complaining about their experience with windows based handhelds like the legion go while praising the steam deck for being user friendly.

Lenovo Laptop is so bad need help very low fps.,"**MODEL**: Legion 5 Pro 16ARH7H

I've sent my laptop to the depot for repairs twice—once last year, which temporarily fixed the issue, but when I sent it back this summer, nothing was resolved.

I'm essentially stuck with a poorly performing laptop that I bought in 2022, and it's been the worst brand experience I've ever had. I suspect the motherboard is the issue, as it seems to be a common problem... When I plug in and unplug the power, I get a big FPS boost for about 10 seconds, but then it quickly drops to 50-70 FPS. There's definitely something wrong. I can't even play casual games like Dota 2 on my RTX 3070 Ti, as it only runs at 40-50 FPS. It's extremely frustrating!

**How did it happen?** The issue happens randomly and doesn't stop until it's repaired. My warranty has expired, and I chose not to extend it because of frustration (thinking about it)

**I've tried everything....** including cleaning the system and using only Lenovo updates from their website. But that's clearly not the issue—the problem lies with the internal components. I suspect it's the motherboard, which seems like a common issue.... Just this morning I even got a BIOS error when booting up. (This happens time to time, and the bios error it gives is also different everytime)

They give 13 October as the date for onsite event today is 12 October. On 11, I received this confirmation of items delivered mail.
 
According to them next step is that a technical engineer is assigned locally for the work order to be done same will be informed through a mail also mentioning his number.

And he can home visit anytime soon according to their schedule.

Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition review. Too many flaws.,"Recently received my new Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition and have been putting it through it's paces. I ordered a custom 258V 1tb spec from Lenovo. Shipping was fast, packaging is about as barebones as it gets with the charger just flailing around in there, but it arrived in one piece so yay I guess.

Some context: Currently use an X1 Carbon G6 because every new laptop I buy is generally flawed or has issues, prompting me to keep my trusty ThinkPad. Recent attempts at upgrading are as follows:

* Surface laptop 4: Pretty good, but had issues with WiFi and Bluetooth constantly dropping, and random restarts. Sold it after a bit.
* Lenovo Slim 7 pro X: Great machine but had two major issues: System would occasionally lock up when the 3050 was enabled in the bios, disabling it fixed the lockups. Also, there seemed to be an issue with nvram causing the laptop to fail to boot numerous times.
* Lenovo Slim pro 7 - Excellent machine, literally zero issues. Truly a unicorn. The build quality was terrible, and thus I returned it. Decent aluminum enclosure, but cheap plastic interior with plastic hinges. Honestly wish I kept it after this.
* Surface Laptop 7 - Excellent laptop. ARM64 turned out to be a larger issue for me than I thought. Sold it and stuck with X86. A few pretty minor issues but otherwise the best windows laptop available right now imo.

Lets get into the Aura.

**Build quality** - It's alright. Typical thin relatively cheap aluminum exterior with an internal frame to keep everything together. Luckily the frame is made of magnesium alloy this time instead of plastic like the slim pro 7. Durability concerns are no more. Port cutouts are somewhat sharp, and you can see inside the laptop from the cutouts. Some ports are slightly misaligned, but everything fits. Certainly not as premium as a surface or a mac, but it'll do. Hinge feels fine, trackpad is installed firm with no rattle. I hate the ""YOGA"" text on the palmrest. It's clearly shiny plastic inserts stuck into a cutout, and not very well mind you, with the text slightly misaligned. It just looks a bit cheap. Overall, it's well built enough for most people to be happy, but it's nowhere near some of it's competitors.

**Display -** Mostly very good. Very bright, very colorful, great pixel density, 120hz, good touch implementation, and completely free of defects. It's not all great though. I generally prefer IPS panels, but the contrast on this one doesn't cut it. All IPS panels have IPS glow, but this one has the worst case of glow I've ever seen. It's even noticeable looking at it straight on, making the panel look almost TN at times. This paired with the relatively poor AR coating create a sub bar display for darker content. It's not terrible, but quite noticeably worse than any typical IPS. Note there is likely a display lottery here, so you're mileage may vary.

**Trackpad / keyboard -** The touchpad is unfortunately not haptic, but it's a very good traditional unit. Smooth surface with a tactile and satisfying click. Feels responsive (when it's working, more on that later), gestures work great, at least as good as they can in W11. Keyboard is excellent, ThinkPad level. Wonderful tactility and travel. The keys also have a soft touch finish to them which feels great. Backlighting is uniform and consistent, if not a little too bright on it's dimmest setting.

**Speakers -** Completely blown away by these. Most windows machines have pretty bad speakers in my experience, but these are excellent. Definitely a bit bass heavy, but no distortion at normal volume levels. They sound full and mostly clear, could do with a bit more midrange. Head and shoulders above any windows machine I've ever used, period.

**Performance / noise -** A little disappointed in the noise output. No complaints with performance, Lunar Lake delivers on what I expected, but the fans are just too noticeable for my taste. Don't get me wrong, huge improvement from my mini jet engine X1C G6 with 8650u when docked, but it's not nearly as quiet as I was hoping for. When docked to my desktop setup via Thunderbolt at 4k 120hz, the fans are frequently noticeable, especially with heavy multitasking. Even unplugged opening a few chrome tabs or an application or two will get the fans to spin up. The system is not hot or even warm really, it's just overly aggressive fan tuning by Lenovo it seems.

**Miscellaneous / software -** WiFi seems to work flawlessly thus far. No dropping of connections, connects upon waking, etc. Bluetooth on the other hand is a little flaky. Occasionally I will hear Bluetooth artifacts and glitches upon moving apart from the laptop. Windows came with some bloat including McAfee, but all was easy to get rid of. Windows hello has been mostly reliable, minus when the system fails to activate the camera and I have to resort to a passcode.

I had a lot of trouble getting reliable video output from this thing with my external monitor being the only and primary display. New display drivers and fiddling around with color settings in Intel control panel seemingly at random allowed me to get reliable 4k 120hz YCbCr 444. No specific setting did the trick, it seems to be a bit broken at the moment. Adding on to the state of Intel software, every time I reboot this thing, Intel graphics control panel decides it wants to set custom colors for me that dramatically darken the display, prompting me to go in and reset all color settings. Tried different drivers among other things to no avail. Very strange issue.

**Phantom touches -** Frequently the touchscreen will activate phantom touches in the bottom right corner, possibly because my primary interaction with the screen is with the quick settings for brightness control. This seems to be especially frequent upon waking from sleep, often making the laptop unusable for up to a minute. Sometimes quick settings or hidden icons tray will pop up randomly as I'm working. Extremely annoying.

**The dealbreakers -** I don't know about you, but I prefer my touchpad to work properly. I mean that cant be too much to ask right? Well, either Lenovo has implemented some sort of braindead power saving feature, or there is some sort of driver / hardware issue. After a period of inactivity, like say 1-3 minutes, the trackpad will frequently enter a ""sleep"" state, and not respond to inputs until it has had a second or two to wake up. Sometimes it takes up to around 10 seconds to wake up, which is extremely annoying. I've tried a few fixes for this, including disabling the touch screen to avoid phantom touches, but the issue persists.

Never experienced anything like this. Leads me to believe there may be something wrong with my touchpad hardware. Even if it is a hardware issue, I'd honestly rather not give Lenovo's QC lottery another shot. Besides, we already have issues with the touchscreen, windows hello, and flaky Intel software, while the Slim Pro 7 I tried was literally flawless. Lenovo can make a good computer, but this isn't one of them, at least mine isn't.

**Conclusion -** I really wanted this to be good. It has massive potential to be the best X86 Windows machine with an LCD. But the buggy touchpad alone is a dealbreaker, not to mention the other quirks. Regardless, I'm not keen on trying a replacement. Will update the post if I manage to fix the trackpad or touchscreen before returning it.

**Edit:** I clean installed Windows 11 today in hopes of fixing the trackpad issues. Only bare essential drivers installed. The system feels much faster now, and no random spinning blue wheel by the cursor, but the trackpad issue persists. Looks like it's going back.

Thoughts on Lenovo today in 2024? (general recommendations),"I got a Lenovo Legion 2060 in 2019 and loved it. I beat the hell out of it - took it with me traveling on a 5 hour bus ride (one way) every week, into classrooms, hospitals, people's homes, you name - I used it as a workstation wherever I went.

Even survived a water spill when it was out of warranty.

I switched to a desktop this year (4080), but am missing the mobility of a laptop.

**TLDR** - are Lenovo brand still considered higher grade than others? I've been reading mixed reports on them these days. I love their keyboards and how they felt, but also am seeing cheaper gaming laptops, and am wondering what I gain from paying extra at this point for Lenovos? (They seem priced generally higher to me still)

Ideal price range is $500-$1000 for something simple, but am willing to spend $1000-1500 if it's a significant boost.

Time to replace my 2015 Lenovo Yoga 700. What's your recommendation? ,"This little computer has gotten me through the last decade. I have used it for college courses, light gaming, conference calls for work, discord with my pals, and various word processing jobs.

Its battery life is also down to about 2-3 hours. 

Previous laptops I have owned (Dell, HP, Compaq) lasted 2-3 years before failing. Because this little Lenovo Yoga lasted so long I want to stick with the brand. I want a newer version of the same computer (or very similar). I love the size and the touchscreen. I don't really need the ""switch-to-tablet"" feature; I hardly used it.

Does your Lenovo USB-c work? About to return a Slim Pro 9 16IRP8,"I bought a Lenovo Slip Pro 9 16IRP8 83C0X007US which advertises a USB-C Thunderbolt 4 port.

I have a usb 3.2 2tb external SSD (crucial)  
When i plug it in, there is an audible tone... but no drive shows up under my computer. After 30secs, I get a error ""USB has malfunctioned"". Under device manager, there is a yellow ""!"" and it says usb port reset failed.

I also tried my Go pro hero 10. It initially recognizes it, but if i transfer a file, it will copy for about 10 seconds, and then stop and give an error.  
If i use samsung DEX to attach it to my android phone, it will connect to my phone for about 20 seconds and then close.

I DID try a new anker TB4 cable... no change. If i plug any of those dives into my older dell laptop, or my desktop etc... all work perfectly.

IF i plug those devices into a USB-a port on the lenovo, they DO work. (just slow)

Here is my dilemma, My return window closes in 10 days.  
I have been working with lenovo support, installed all drivers, updated everything, reinstalled windows... they now want me to send the laptop in for repair, but i really have little faith in there ability to fix the issue.  
Do you have a slim Pro 9i with a working USB-C TB4 port?

I did see a few negative reviews listed where people were not being able to charge via the port, oddly enough, mine DOES charge via the port.

From the manual: ""Multi-purpose USB Type-C connector – Supports maximum signaling rate of 41.25 Gbps in Thunderbolt mode– Supports SuperSpeed USB 10 Gbps– Supports DisplayPort Alt Mode (DisplayPort 1.4 compliant)– Supports power output up to 15 W (5 V, 3 A)– Supports USB Power Delivery""",3,1g29fj1,Lenovo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lenovo/comments/1g29fj1/does_your_lenovo_usbc_work_about_to_return_a_slim/,2,2024-10-12 20:45:22,Reddit,"I bought a Lenovo Slip Pro 9 16IRP8 83C0X007US which advertises a USB-C Thunderbolt 4 port.

Here is my dilemma, My return window closes in 10 days.  
I have been working with lenovo support, installed all drivers, updated everything, reinstalled windows... they now want me to send the laptop in for repair, but i really have little faith in there ability to fix the issue.  
Do you have a slim Pro 9i with a working USB-C TB4 port?

I did see a few negative reviews listed where people were not being able to charge via the port, oddly enough, mine DOES charge via the port.

From the manual: ""Multi-purpose USB Type-C connector – Supports maximum signaling rate of 41.25 Gbps in Thunderbolt mode– Supports SuperSpeed USB 10 Gbps– Supports DisplayPort Alt Mode (DisplayPort 1.4 compliant)– Supports power output up to 15 W (5 V, 3 A)– Supports USB Power Delivery""",bought lenovo slip pro 9 16irp8 83c0x007us advertises usb c thunderbolt 4 port usb 3 2 2tb external ssd crucial plug audible tone drive show computer 30secs get error usb malfunctioned device manager yellow say usb port reset failed also tried go pro hero 10 initially recognizes transfer file copy 10 second stop give error use samsung dex attach android phone connect phone 20 second close try new anker tb4 cable change plug dive older dell laptop desktop etc work perfectly plug device usb port lenovo work slow dilemma return window close 10 day working lenovo support installed driver updated everything reinstalled window want send laptop repair really little faith ability fix issue slim pro 9i working usb c tb4 port see negative review listed people able charge via port oddly enough mine charge via port manual multi purpose usb type c connector support maximum signaling rate 41 25 gbps thunderbolt mode support superspeed usb 10 gbps support displayport alt mode displayport 1 4 compliant support power output 15 w 5 v 3 support usb power delivery

My First Lenovo machine - T14  but ...,"Yesterday i bought my first Lenovo product from local store. it is Thinkpad T14 AMD Ryzen 5 pro machine with 16GB(8\*8) RAm and 512GB SSD.

But it has two issues..

1. one with windows 10 pro which comes with the machine which has OEM key.can not use it's task bar search option.most of the time can not type longer text to search,even i can type there is appear search preview window then disappear. so far i tried few things internet suggest except clean windows installation.hope it will solve with clean installation.
2. second one look serious to me,maybe you would see as it is.. There is a [rubber like frame](https://i.imgur.com/SvcJQ78.jpeg) around display edge..rubber frame looks like melted/feel sticky when touch with finger..not every when on rubber frame but most of areas..when you close the laptop around the display and upper part of bottom chassis stick together.when you open lids can heard sound of both are separating..  because of this i close lids after putting polythene in between. can not use paper or tissues,you know the reason.

I travel via plane quite often for work so I'm not really waiting for a sale as I would like to get the order process started as delivery may take a few months.

I'm curious about purchasing from this particular AliExpress store and I'm interested to hear your opinions on them. Also few questions I had:

1. When did you purchase it and what firmware version did you receive?

2. If you're from US, did you receive your package already opened? (perhaps customs opened it?)

Very slow POST boot Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro,"Device: Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro 14ACH5 82MS

It came with pre installed Windows 11, its been just a bit more than a year since I bought it. And then I immediately started dual booting it with Linux (**Note: I made a separate FAT32 EFI partition to keep Windows EFI and Linux EFI separate^**), and I’ve played around with the boot menu, and also some other installations. I have installed and uninstalled Linux OSs at least 5-10 times, and I always delete the specific boot entry from the efi boot menu and also from the efi boot partition. 

^ The Partition order looks something like this:
1. Windows EFI (ntfs) 276MiB
2. Windows partition (ntfs) 183GiB
3. My Linux EFI partition (fat32) 512MiB
4. … (my linux partitions) here I have added and deleted many partitions. 
5. and at the end I have a 30GiB partition for cloud sync service. 

*(in this exact order)*

So, at one point of installing and uninstalling or something, I don’t exactly remember what I did, but I did something I guess and after that day it always takes a long time to boot, but after GRUB opens up (or after the POST phase) it is very quick. In fact initially when it happened I couldn’t even boot into windows and I fixed it using an external USB with windows and did system recovery and then windows works fine after that. 

I figured getting windows working might solve the issue, but it didn’t. 

I would really like to get this fixed. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.",2,1g0xarp,pcmasterrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1g0xarp/very_slow_post_boot_lenovo_yoga_slim_7_pro/,0,2024-10-11 00:22:03,Reddit,"Device: Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro 14ACH5 82MS

I'm looking to buy a new gaming laptop with a 100% sRGB display, an i7 or Ryzen 7 processor, and an RTX 4050 graphics card, all under 79k.

It has been reviewed by people like JarrodsTech, Matthew Moniz, We Do Tech as arguably the best budget gaming laptop. Here is some key points I found: 

- Very good thermals to other similar spec computers in benchmarks

- Higher build quality compared to other similar laptops

-Better design: The ports are all behind which makes it convenient for cable management

It has been reviewed by people like JarrodsTech, Matthew Moniz, We Do Tech as arguably the best budget gaming laptop. Here is some key points I found: 

- Very good thermals to other similar spec computers in benchmarks

- Higher build quality compared to other similar laptops

-Better design: The ports are all behind which makes it convenient for cable management

-Great pricing: It has a very nice competitive price for its specs.

Am I overpaying for my Lenovo repair?,"Hello, recently my Lenovo laptop had an issue starting up. Basically everything seemed to work (I had power and such), but it got stuck at a black screen and would not start. I tried resetting the BIOS hardware, checked my RAM and also my battery but nothing worked for me. After trying for a day or two I decided to get it repaired by Lenovo. I assumed it would end up costing me some money but kinda got discouraged by the amount. I was wondering if it’s normal to pay €640 for a repair after already paying for a diagnosis and also for shipping. Especially since the laptop just stopped working on its own and is only 2 and a half years old. I used to have a Dell and complain about the in hindsight minor software issues I had. Now I kinda wished that instead of trying so salvage my Lenovo i would have just bought a Dell laptop for the price of its repair alone. :( :(  I have not committed to paying yet, and was hoping for some opinions on if I should get it back and send it to a private repair shop instead.

Why do i get the Lenovo logo on boot,"So when i boot up my laptop it shows for 1 millisecond the logo of Lenovo (a flicker / flash kind of) in the bottom right corner. 

I don't know what that is I've been having this for almost a month now and my laptop is 3months old. 
I've updated bios but it still doesn't go away, I've also searched alot of forums but couldn't find people with the same issue. 

At first i thought it was because i accidentally put my mouse cable under my screen when closing but that is weird if it would show a Lenovo logo.

"Can you play pc games like Far cry 6, Cyberpunk 2077 etc from a Lenovo Legion Go on the Meta Quest 3/3s?","Hi all,

I've only been able to find an old thread on this subject from 11 months ago which didn't really give much info.

My question is, is it possible to use a Meta Quest 3/3s effectively as a monitor to run games such as Far Cry 6,  Robocop, Watch dogs Legion, Cyberpunk 2077 etc from a Lenovo Legion Go?

If so, what methods are people using (streaming from the LeGo or using USB c - USB c), and if streaming, which software on the LeGo and Quest?

What sort of results are you getting? What are the downsides you've experienced?

I haven't been getting good results in running my LeGo to our TV and we don't have the space for a dedicated monitor, so looking for an alternative solution. 

I'm not that fussed about VR games, just want a way to play my pc games on a bigger screen.

Up for sale is the Lenovo Legion OLED Slim 5 Gen 8 (14APH8) 14.5"" laptop AMD 7840HS, RTX 4060, 32GB RAM, 1 TB SSD with 15 months warranty including accidental protection. Sale comes with original Lenovo laptop charger and box.

I bought this laptop for its stunning and beautiful OLED screen paired with a powerful RTX 4060. However, I no longer have the time to game.

I am the original owner and I purchased this directly from the Lenovo Pro website.

The laptop has been used extremely lightly. I have had maybe 5x short 1-2 hour gaming sessions on it while powered. Battery has seen minimal use. While plugged in, battery charging has been limited to 80% to maintain longevity.

The laptop is in perfect condition with no scratches at all. It works beautifully without any issues. Zero overheating on intensive games like Cyberpunk 2077 or Call of Duty. Gorgeous HDR. No dead pixels. OLED screen is in perfect condition. The laptop has been regularly and gently dusted and comes from a smoke-free and animal-free home.

The laptop is still under warranty with accidental protection. The warranty is transferable as Lenovo warranties the serial number of its laptops and not the purchaser.

Any questions are welcome.

Price: $1250 including shipping. No trades.

Lenovo ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 Won't Charge with Dell U2723QE USB-C Hub Monitor,"Also posted in /r/UsbCHardware

I have a new Lenovo Thinkpad P14s Gen 5 which came with a 135W USB-C power supply, though it will happily charge (slowly) from less powerful USB-PD supplies.

I have a Dell U2723QE monitor that can supply up to 90W via its USB-C port.

I am using a Ugreen USB4 cable, though I have also tried a Cable Creation USB4 cable as well as the cable that came with the monitor itself.

When connecting this new laptop to the monitor, the display and other dock functions (USB ports, ethernet, etc.) work, but it will not charge the laptop.

If I plug the laptop into the monitor before turning it on, I get a warning about a low wattage adater (8W) despite the fact that my Power-Z meter shows 90W USB-PD being negotiated.

Laptop is on latest BIOS as of 2024-10-11 (1.18), as is the monitor (M2T105)

This same monitor and cables work perfectly fine with: 

* Lenovo ThinkBook 14 G2
* Microsoft Surface Laptop 3, Surface Book 2, Surface Laptop Studio
* Dell XPS 15 9530
* Dell Latitude 7300
* HP EliteBook x360 1030 G2

At work I have a Lenovo USB-C Gen 2 dock that uses a 90W adapter to the dock, and only supplies 65W over USB-C to the laptop.  All functions are fine except for the slow charging.

Do you think this is an issue with the Thunderbolt 4 ports on the new laptop, a BIOS/firmware issue, or something else (i.e a stupid ""feature"")?

I already know that 6.25A over a USB-C is against the standard, but what else is ""broken?""

CPU temperature reaches 90-100°C in games with charger connected. Lenovo Legion 5-15ACH6,"Hi,  
I have a Ryzen-5600H processor. My processor temperature reaches 90-100 degrees in games with charger connected. The system was cleaned a few weeks ago and the thermal pads were replaced. Also the hardware was checked for damage and none was found. The temperature reaches a maximum of 100 degrees, so I assume that the problem is in the software.  
  
I tried:  
 - To limit the power usage in 'Control Panel\\Hardware and Sound\\Power Options\\Edit Plan Settings' -> Advanced settings -> Processor Power Management -> Maximum processor state. Any % ranged from 0 to 99 did absolutely nothing to cpu temperatures.  
 - To install Ryzen Master. It does not work on laptops.  
 - To update BIOS. BIOS is up to date.  
 - To install ""Ryzen Ctrl"" and limit cpu temperature there. This one worked out, but the game Im playing considers this program as security violation, so not an option.  
 - To set Power Mode on battery to ""Best battery life"". No difference.  
 - To set performance mode to ""quiet"" using Fn+Q hotkeys. \~3-5°C difference.

"Lenovo LOQ fan makes a ""creck"" sound when starting — is this normal?","Hi everyone,

I recently got a Lenovo LOQ with an RTX 2050, and I've noticed that the fan makes a ""creck"" sound when it goes from being off to turning on, especially in **balanced mode**. The sound happens only when the fan starts spinning, and then it stops. In **silent mode**, this doesn't happen.

I'm wondering if anyone else with this laptop (or a similar model) has experienced this. Is this behavior expected? Should I be concerned about the sound, or is it just part of the fan management?

"For someone in the US who’s planning to buy a Lenovo Legion Y700 2023, what should I do know before I buy?","I’ve been taking a look at small or mini sized tablets so I can consume media and read books/PDFs. I’m primarily an iPhone user but figured I’d go with something different and new.

I’ve come across the Y700, despite it being advertised primarily as a gaming tablet, I figured the extra performance certainly won’t hurt as it’ll last longer and will result in faster/more responsive browsing.

So now to the buying part, I’m from the US and it seems that the only place to purchase one of these bad boys is from AliExpress, I’ve had some questions below:

1. Which AliExpress seller is the best to purchase this from?
2. Do I need to watch for different “ROM” versions, I briefly read about Chinese and Japanese ROMs and how some of them may be more restrictive than others.

If there is anything that a new buyer of the Y700 should know, please relay the information here. Thanks!

Condition is excellent, just a slight scuff on the edge of the lid. Other than that, nothing wrong with it. Mostly dust free, barely used. No smoke, no pets.

348 days warranty remaining with option to extend for 1-3 more years. Battery has 9 cycles. Will come with stock charger and 3 months of game pass. 

Currently looking for local pickup (cash only) - $975 - East Bay area (Norcal) but may consider shipping at a later date. Though that is not preferred as I do not have the ideal box. Let me know if there are any other questions. Please comment down below before pm.

Condition is excellent, just a slight scuff on the edge of the lid. Other than that, nothing wrong with it. Mostly dust free, barely used. No smoke, no pets. GPU temps in the 60s with Cyberpunk ray/path-traced and default fan speed.  

348 days warranty remaining with option to extend for 1-3 more years. Battery has 9 cycles. Will come with stock charger and 3 months of game pass. 

Currently looking for local pickup (cash only) - $975 - East Bay area (Norcal) but may consider shipping at a later date. Though that is not preferred as I do not have the ideal box. Let me know if there are any other questions. Please comment down below before pm.

Old lenovo laptop windows 7 Pro fresh install,"Someone I know asked me if I could do a fresh windows installation on their old lenovo thinkpad. I didn't realize windows 7 didn't have a built in reset function like windows 10/11. As far as I am aware there are two main methods of doing a clean installation:

Bootable CD/DVD/USB (I have none of those),

Recovery Partition if the manufacturer made one (They did not)

Now I know you can make a bootable USB by downloading the correct ISO file from somewhere. In my case that would be Win7 Pro. 
Problem is, the official Microsoft download website doesn't offer windows 7 downloads anymore. So I began looking for other sources and found one on Internet Archive. 

My question is: 
If I download that iso file and copy it onto a USB Drive, assuming the file is good, can I just make the laptop boot from it and it'll work? Assuming I can even boot from it since the laptop has a bios password and I don't know if I need it to change boot priority. But say all that works out, would that work to install windows 7 Pro or am I missing anything? I also have the product key for windows.

Yet... it has a Ryzen 7 8845HS processor. Which isnt ridiculously fast but very efficient power-wise, also because of a pretty decent iGPU.

Wouldnt all this make its battery life for unplugged work-related stuff mazing still?

Flipkart Screwed Me Over Big Time – Still No Laptop Replacement After two Month!,"Let me tell you all how Flipkart has absolutely failed me. I ordered a laptop (It was my first laptop... I have been dreaming for a gaming laptop for so long)  on July 23rd, got it on July 28th, and it died within TWO DAYS. Yeah, two freaking days, and the laptop wouldn’t even turn on. So, I requested a return. What followed is a masterclass in corporate incompetence.

Flipkart’s brilliant ""support"" told me a technician visit would happen before August 11th. Spoiler alert: It didn’t. So, I had to call Flipkart’s dumb f*ck customer support EVERY SINGLE DAY after that, and each time I had to explain the whole situation all over again. Every time, they’d give me the same line: “We’re raising a ticket with the upper team, you’ll get a resolution within 24 hours.” Guess what? NO RESOLUTION EVER CAME. It was like talking to a brick wall.

When I finally pressed them, they tell me, “Oh, it’s still under process” until August 17th. And then after days of waiting and explaining myself for the millionth time, I finally got to talk to a senior exec. Their solution? ""Contact Lenovo. We can’t help you."" I’m sorry, WHAT?! After weeks of back-and-forth, that’s their answer? Passing the buck?

So, I reached out to Lenovo. They told me that Flipkart should’ve created a case number with them for the replacement. But of course, Flipkart didn’t do that. This means Lenovo couldn't even replace my laptop as the 7-day replacement window was gone. Now I'm stuck with only part replacement, all because Flipkart didn’t handle their end of the deal. Like, what the actual f*ck?

Thankfully, after explaining the entire mess Flipkart made, Lenovo took matters into their own hands. They finally sent an engineer to check up the laptop and it was covered under DOA, then he picked up the faulty laptop. Got my refund at long last, but the amount of time and effort wasted is insane... 2 MONTHS to be exact.

Fan Noise,"Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 8, Windows 11.

A few days ago, one of the fans on my computer began running extremely quickly and making loud, disturbing sounds.

I updated my BIOS and all my drivers, and the problem resolved itself for about a day before resuming. I have done some diagnostic scans, nothing seems to be wrong with any of the other hardware. 

I had the fans replaced in this computer just a few months ago, so there should be nothing wrong with these, but increasingly unsure. If it is a faulty part in need of replacement, should I order a new one and install on my own or go through Lenovo? My original warranty has expired, not sure if I can get coverage if the replacement part they gave me is defective. 

Video of the sound here (it varies in frequency):

Which one should I get?,"I've been looking at two laptops to buy and found two that I need deciding on. First is a Lenovo Legion Slim 5 and the second is a ASUS TUF Gaming A15. 

The Lenovo costs $1600

* Ryzen 7 8845HS
* RTX 4070
* 32 GB RAM
* 2TB SSD

The Asus cost $1235

* Ryzen 7 7940HS
* RTX 4070
* 16GB DDR5
* 1TB SSD

If I choose the Asus I would also buy 32GB LPDDR5 and another 2TB SSD with my total coming to about $1436, still $170 cheaper than the Lenovo. I'll have to open up the laptop which I am not too uncomfortable with. The Lenovo comes with a higher resolution but I don't really care about the screen because I use an external monitor.

Lenovo Legion Go or something else for a disabled gamer? ,"Best Device for Disabled Gamer?

My entire life, I’ve preferred to play video games on a Mouse & Keyboard. I would still do so - except now I have 3 kids. Holing myself off in my office during all hours of the night isn’t really an option.

I’ve switched to Mobile Gaming pretty much exclusively. As a former LoL player, I’ve had a lot of fun on both Wild Rift & TFT. With that being said; anyone who knows what mobile gaming is like…. Knows the downfalls. MicroTransactions / P2W, no great MMORPGs or Shooters. Really just lacking in the overall AAA gaming genre.

Here’s my second hang up…. I am missing my right thumb. It has been amputate past the joint. While it still is somewhat functional, I type this message to you on my phone using my left thumb and right index finger. I’m NOT so sure how I would be controlling a joystick. When playing more intensive games like Wild Rift, I use my left thumb to control movement and 2-3 fingers on my right hand.

I’m DYING to get some high quality gaming action. I would really like to try one of the handhelds. I had absolutely no idea how far this space has come. I obviously remember Gameboy Color, Nintendo DS, and PSP. 

Here’s what’s important / not important to me.

**Important:**

Available games. I want to be able to seamlessly and easily play a large category of games. I really like MMORPGs, ARPGs, FPS, MOBAs, and sports games. 

Multiplayer experience. I have no desire to play a device that’s going to be primarily offline games. While I would like to try out some of the new solo RPGs like the Witcher & Baldur’s Gate, I really have to be able to play with other people to enjoy my time.

Quality of device. I need something that will hold up, and is just an amazing piece of machinery. I want to be able to play anything without lag.

**Not Important**

Battery Life. I will only be playing this device from home. The battery life is not important at all. But if it needs to be plugged in at times while playing; I would hope it’s not overheating on me

Docking Mode. I don’t really care if I’m never able to play the device on the TV. My kids and wife pretty much have staked claim to our TV.

Price. I do not currently own any high dollar systems besides my IPhone 16 Pro Max. I have a brand new MacBook that’s strictly used for work. No PS5/Xbox/Gaming Rig. I’m willing to spend $2,000+ on this device.


Really would love to hear y’all’s opinions.

Lenovo not charging ,"I’ve noticed that for the last two weeks when I charged my idea pad 5 sometimes it wouldn’t charge. Usually it was fixed by unplugging and replugging the cord .

The power button trick doesn’t work and in the charge port light whenever I plug it in, on some occasions it will blink orange and then stop blinking indicating it’s no longer charging at this point should I just take out the back cover and replace the battery?

How many use their Legion mainly for software development?,"I'm mainly a programmer, but I like gaming too. At my previous job a few years ago, I was issued a Dell XPS 15 Pro.

My 1st Homelab,"So, I’ve got a two-story house, and my networking gear, home audio, Synology NAS (6x16TB WD Gold Drives), Xbox, and a mini PC (Proxmox hosting Emby + other GPU-dependent images) are all set up in an AC room on the second floor. I also have a multi-room home audio system with multiple Sonos amps, allowing me to play music throughout the house. I still need to get two more Sonos amps—one to replace my Alexa amp and another for new speakers I added to the lanai (replacing a pair of Sonos SLs).

But under the stairs on the first floor, I’ve got my home lab rack. This setup includes additional networking gear (running at 10Gb between floors), my 1st floor cameras, and access points. Here’s what my home lab looks like:

	•	Top server: Dell R250 (64GB RAM, Xeon E-2378G)
	•	Second server: Lenovo SR250 (64GB RAM, Xeon E-2176G)

I’ve got 4U of space left in the rack, and I’m considering using it in the future to tinker with AI/ML using a GPU. Maybe something like LLaMA, just to experiment.

So why is my homelab under the stairs?

One reason: noise. The Lenovo SR250 sounds like a jet engine running 24/7, and the AC closet upstairs backs up to my primary bedroom—I really didn’t want to hear that constantly. Plus, my rack upstairs only supports a 20” depth, whereas the first-floor rack can handle full-depth servers.

Another benefit is that the space under the stairs has its own AC vent and exhaust into the laundry room, so the equipment down there stays at a comfortable ~76°F, while my upstairs rack is around 78°F (I still need to add doors and an exhaust to the collector in the AC room).

Why low-power servers?

Simple: I want my homelab to run during a power outage! My house took a direct hit from Hurricane Milton, and between all my fridges, two chest coolers, both racks, and lights around the house, I’m only hitting about 1kW. With three Powerwalls and some load-shedding automation (shutting down power-hungry devices when my Powerwall reaches certain percentages), I’ve got a setup that keeps running when the grid goes down.

With the way my load shedding is set up, I can run my house—including AC—for up to 3 days without recharging from solar. That was my target. And after most hurricanes, the sun usually comes out after 2 days, so I’m able to recharge quickly thanks to my 16kWh solar array. With a house that’s ~4700 square feet, the system fills up the batteries fast and keeps us comfortable.

Pic I added is when the outage with Milton occurred, FPL did a good job and we weren’t down for lot than 7 hours before our power was restored. 

Cable Management Confession:

I’ll admit, I haven’t done the most amazing cable management on the first floor. I ran out of time since I just got the rack running before we had to evacuate due to Milton. That’s definitely on my list to fix!


Question:

Anyone else done something similar with their homelab? If so, what do you recommend for a self-hosted ML/AI box? I’m looking for ideas for when I fill up that extra rack space lol.

Story time: how did I almost lose my T480s because of a stupid Wi-Fi card upgrade,"So, I've bought an AX201 for my T480s some months ago, but since it was the wrong model (the connector didn't fit), I wasn't able to do the upgrade in that time. I initially removed the card and put it back on. 

Some days ago I recieved an AX210 with the correct entrance, but in the last time I opened it, I think I have put too much torque on the screw, so I wasn't able to remove the card and I got the head of the screw damaged of trying. So I putted the cover back and tried to turn it on, but it didn't turn on by any mean, even with the charger, and I panicked. My first thought: I've put too much pressure on the card screw and I f*cked the motherboard up. 

For context, I forgot to manually disconnect the battery through the BIOS. 

I went on an authorised assistance, and the guy simply used a SIM card tray to press the back button (I forgot about that due to my state of nervous) and yeah, it's working fine. I think the problem was an peak of electrical current and the pc auto-killed the energy supply to not die. I'm now doing a hardware test in Lenovo Vantage to make sure everything is fine 

Thanks Lenovo for doing such a good product and idiot proof

Not happy with Lenovo's Warranty Repairs at the moment.,"TLDR: Monitor had tinted color patches develop after 9 months of usage, but was half usable. Failed repair attempt on Oct. 2nd rendered laptop completely unusable. Tech did everything by the books at my house, Lenovo sent wrong parts and defective parts. After 2nd failed repair attempt, laptop is now waiting to be sent in for depot service.

Full Timeline:

1. September 18th, 2024, I noticed some pink tinted patches on my laptop's miniLED monitor, on closer inspection, I noticed there were some pink bars going across the screen as well (it was light, but noticeable). I think it's been there for a few months, but I thought the monitor was just a bit dirty. It got worse over time, and it became apparent. The laptop is 9 months old and never been abused (been dealing with long COVID, been mostly housebound and frequently bedridden actually).
2. Back and forth with Lenovo tech support because the problem was hard to photograph.
3. They outsource the fix to Hammersbach. There were some miscommunication on scheduling, but they finally sent a tech to come on October 2nd to attempt the repair.
4. Lenovo sent the tech just the miniLED panel (not the complete assembly). The whole thing is held together with glue, and in an attempt to pry the panel off, the monitor was cracked and rendered useless. Failed repair attempt, now I don't have a laptop to use. Tech also noted that the miniLED panel inside was completely delaminated which most likely resulted in the pink patches and bars I was seeing.
5. October 7th, the tech told me Lenovo sent him the monitor disassembled. He has to assemble it and port over the webcam module from the old monitor. He assembles it, but the webcam module was bulging the screen out a it. Also he could not get the old hinge piece onto the new assemble, and it kept popping off. After closer inspection, he can see some cracks in the plastic on the new assembly, and suspect the part was damaged.
6. Tech and I discuss it and decide depot repair would be better since they'll have more parts on hand, instead of having to do this back and forth thing where they keep sending him out. Tech also mentions in the past with my particular model, Lenovo would send the entire monitor assembly totally assembled and he doesn't understand why Lenovo stopped doing it.
7. Currently waiting on the shipping box from Lenovo. NOT HAPPY WITH THE SERVICE RIGHT NOW AND I'M STUCK USING MY DESKTOP IN THE TIME BEING!

Also I should mention, I fix my own electronics (out of warranty ones), know how to solder, read schematics, and will even swap phone batteries for my friends. The Hammersbach technician is not to blame. He did everything by the books and has been professional the entire time. The blame rests with Lenovo.

Status of Ubuntu Support: Thinkpad P15 Gen 1,"(Cross-posting from Lenovo's forum:  I realize this may not be a great match for this sub, but since Ubuntu is one of the ""mothership"" distros..., thought I'd give it a shot.)

It is nearing time for me to upgrade the OS on my P15 Gen1.  Currently running factory installed Ubuntu 20.04LTS.

I'm curious as to Lenovo's current relationship with Canonical/Ubuntu..., and whether or not there is a validated upgrade path for this machine.

At the moment, I've tried:

* Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS:  Display and keyboard problems, at minimum.  Default boot suffers huge rendering failure maybe 1 min after entering graphical mode.  ""Safe"" (or whatever it's called) mode renders OK..., but then has keyboard problems.  Seems to have power management issues as well but can't be sure.
* Linux Mint 22:  Total bust.  PROBABLY Nouveau's nvidia support is the main issue..., but system comes up neither in default nor safe modes.
* PopOS 22.04:  Seems to work completely.  Ships with a working set of NVidia drivers (550)..., everything seems to work, including power management.

I'm probably OK with going the PopOS route..., but any other suggestions would be interesting as well.  I am trying to stay with Debian derived distros.

Also..., in the spirit of my original decision to get the P15 with ""factory installed"" Ubuntu..., I'm REALLY trying to minimize the science experiment aspect of this.

Would greatly appreciate anyone giving advice on which one to buy from the three listed above!",hello everyone like advice laptop choose following price converted vietnamese dong live vietnam lenovo ideapad slim 5 14ahp9 r7 8845hs ai 16gb 512gb 14 wuxga amd radeon 780m win 11 873 89 usd lenovo yoga slim 7 14imh9 ultra 7 155h ai 32gb 512gb 14 wuxga win11 1208 30 usd asus zenbook 14 oled ux3405ma ultra 5 125h ai 16gb 512gb 14 2 8k intel arc win11 1047 14 usd edit1 thinkbook 14 g6 2024 ryzen 7 8845h ram 32gb ssd 1tb amd radeon graphic 14 5inch 2k 120hz 966 65 usd buying new laptop moment bringing laptop school dell g3 3500 even last 2 hour looking laptop last least 6 hour without charge really hard time choosing three slightly leaning towards zenbook price display two month decide waiting black friday deal unless one think bring anything good looking newly released laptop new zenbook overpriced vietnam moment 1850usd lenovo yoga slim 7i aura edition even available priority simply good display decent good battery life would greatly appreciate anyone giving advice one buy three listed
Lapop temizliği,Bundan öncesinde monster laptop kullaniyordum ve 6 ayda bir ucretsiz temizlik yapiyorlardı. Şimdi lenovoya geçtim ve temizliği lenovo servisinde veya vatan bilgisayar gibi mağazalarda yaptırabiliyor muyum ? Eğer öyleyse bu işlemi bana çok uçuk fiyata mı yaparlar ? Ona göre kendim yapmayı öğreneceğim mecbur.

"Looking for a laptop in 55k-65k range, but confused","
I'm looking for a laptop for coding, light to moderate editing and just a bit of casual gaming now and then like Valorant, GTA 5, Forza etc. and want a decent battery backup of let's say 4-5hrs with non gaming tasks. In a budget of 55k-65k

But every laptop I look at has something or the other going on about it. For example Lenovo LOQ's MBO issues (which are said to be fixed by now but doesn't quite convince me) and the way half the folks in this sub root for LOQ is weird. Other gaming laptops like ASUS TUF series are good but people say the battery backup is bad, HP Victus seems right and HP has good service but build quality and battery issues.

Acer Swift Go 14 looks good in the bucket of non gaming laptops but it has Intel 13th gen which has their own issues from what I've heard. 

Finally I'm left with Asus Vivobook 16x which is almost the best of both worlds with Intel 12th gen H series, RTX 3050 and lightweight compared to others. But then there aren't good reviews about the battery backup and also, screen bleeding issues.

So finally it gets really tiring to search for laptops where it either compromises on battery backup or has issues which raise questions on reliability and longevity over 2-3 years. 


Any suggestions will be appreciated.",33,1g2hkse,LaptopDealsIndia,https://i.redd.it/nq733oxl8gud1.jpeg,45,2024-10-13 04:13:30,Reddit,"

Ubuntu on external SSD shows up on one device but not other.,"I own two laptops, one for home and one for student activities. Both of them run Windows 10. The home laptop is a Dell XPS 15 and the school laptop is a Lenovo Yoga 5i.

I managed to install Ubuntu on a Kingston XS2000 500gb portable external SSD. I can use it fine on the Dell laptop, had to do some configurations but works fine. Installation was all done on the Dell laptop.

I want to now boot that Ubuntu SSD on my Lenovo Yoga 5i laptop but the SSD does not show up in the boot menu. 

I had the same issue on the Dell laptop and there I had to manually set a new boot option that points to a shimx64.efi and name it Ubuntu. It will permanently show up on the Dell laptop when I enter the boot menu regardless if SSD is plugged in or not but I guess that's fine.
